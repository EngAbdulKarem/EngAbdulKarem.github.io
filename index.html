            I am Abd al-Karim Osama Sahwil. I successfully completed my studies from the University of Palestine in 2020, as I majored in civil engineering. I have sufficient experience as a civil engineer. I have a passion and love for learning and trying everything new in a way that benefits me and develops my capabilities.

        <h3 class="h3">why i applying for the program</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(137, 106, 167);">
            Why do I apply for this program? Well, there are a lot of reasons, perhaps I will define them through points:
            <ol style="color: rgb(58, 45, 234);">
                <li>
                    I need a semi-fixed source of income to improve my income and my life
                </li>
                <li>
                    My passion for learning is also what led me here, as I always want to improve my skills, not only in my field of civil engineering, but also in all fields, and perhaps I may transform the programming of pages into a service that will benefit me as a civil engineer.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p style="color: rgb(211, 97, 120);">
            These are the two points that prompted me to apply for this program, but I really have a passion for learning.
            Also, perhaps actually, the biggest motive for me to apply was to find a way to not get a semi-fixed income that is better for myself and for my life, as my field is difficult for me to get a job or a permanent or semi-permanent job because of the reality and the actual difficult circumstances in which we live.
